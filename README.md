# symbol-quick-pane package

A package to provide a small extra pane with a list of symbols in the current
editor (or project?), allowing a simple click to jump to the definition.

This is (hopefully) a nicer, easier-to-use alternative to the current
`symbols-view:toggle-project-symbols` command.

Wow, atom has changed quite a bit since this was last updated. I believe this is no longer useful.
